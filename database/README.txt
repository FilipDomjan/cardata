These are two databases for the CarData website
If you want to test the website simply import these two databases into MySQL phpmyadmin

Once the files have been imported into the database you simply need to open the website using XAMPP (or any other service which does
the same) and start the website. To access rest of the site you will need to login. Login page is accessed by clicking the "Login"
